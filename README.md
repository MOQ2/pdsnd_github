### Project Title
Bikeshare Company Data Analysis

### Description
This project is a comprehensive exploration of advanced Python programming concepts applied to bikeshare data analysis. It includes various scripts and modules that demonstrate the use of advanced data structures, algorithms, and libraries. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of Python's capabilities and best practices in data analysis.

The primary goal of this project is to analyze bikeshare data from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. By leveraging Python's powerful data manipulation and analysis libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, the project performs a series of data transformations and computations to extract meaningful insights from the raw bikeshare data.

### Features
- Implementation of data filtering by city, month, and day.
- Calculation of statistics on the most frequent times of travel.
- Analysis of the most popular stations and trips.
- Calculation of trip duration statistics.
- User statistics analysis including user types, gender, and birth year.

### Files used
- bikeshare_2.py: Main script for data analysis.
- data/chicago.csv: Data file for Chicago.
- data/new_york_city.csv: Data file for New York City.
- data/washington.csv: Data file for Washington.

### Usage
Run the main script using the following command:
```bash
python bikeshare_2.py
```
